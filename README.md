## Overview

**Guess the Pair Web Game Two-Player VS** is a browser‑based memory matching game where two players face off to find hidden matching pairs of cards. Enjoy smooth animations, responsive design, and real‑time score tracking in this classic, interactive game that requires no installation—just open your browser and play!

## Installation

No installation is needed. Serve the files using any HTTP/HTTPS server (e.g., Apache, GitHub Pages, or a static hosting service) and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Objective:**  
  Players take turns flipping cards to reveal them. Score points by successfully matching pairs. The player with the most pairs found wins the game.
  
- **Game Flow:**  
  1. **Setup:** At the start, the game board displays cards face-down.  
  2. **Turns:** Player One clicks two cards to reveal them. If they match, they stay revealed and the player scores. If not, they flip back, and it’s Player Two’s turn.  
  3. **Win Condition:** When all pairs are found, the scores are compared and a winner is declared.
  
- **Controls:**  
  Use the mouse (or touch) to click on cards. The interface highlights selected cards and shows immediate feedback upon a match.

## Technologies Used
